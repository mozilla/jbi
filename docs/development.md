# Development

- `make start`: run the application locally (http://localhost:8000)
- `make test`: run the unit tests suites
- `make lint`: static analysis of the code base

You may consider:

* Tweaking the application settings in the `.env` file (See [jbi/environment.py](../jbi/environment.py) for details)
* Installing a pre-commit hook to lint your changes with `pre-commit install`
